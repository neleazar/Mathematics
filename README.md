# F1 Vector Spaces Module

## Overview

In this project I have developed my firt a Python module named `F1` that allows users to create and manipulate vector spaces over the field `F1` (the field with one element). The module provides functionalities to create vector spaces, find subspaces, compute direct sums, quotient spaces, `F1` linear maps and perform other related computations. This project is part of my ongoing research at the university, where I am exploring the properties and applications of vector spaces over `F1`.

## Features

- **Create F1 Vector Spaces**: Define vector spaces over `F1`.
- **Subspaces**: Identify and work with subspaces of a given vector space.
- **Direct Sums**: Compute the direct sum of subspaces.
- **Quotient Spaces**: Compute the quotient spaces.
- **F1 Linear Maps**: Create the `F1` linear maps between two `F1` Vector spaces.
- **Future Work**: Plans to implement additional methods and functionalities.

- **To see the usage of F1 see the [test.ipynb](https://github.com/neleazar/Mathematics/blob/main/test.ipynb).**
