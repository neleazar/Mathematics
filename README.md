# F1 Vector Spaces Module

## Overview

This project is a Python module named `F1` that allows users to create and manipulate vector spaces over the field \( F_1 \) (the field with one element). The module provides functionalities to create vector spaces, find subspaces, compute direct sums, and perform other related computations. This project is part of my ongoing research at the university, where I am exploring the properties and applications of vector spaces over \( F_1 \).

## Features

- **Create Vector Spaces**: Define vector spaces over \( F_1 \).
- **Subspaces**: Identify and work with subspaces of a given vector space.
- **Direct Sums**: Compute the direct sum of subspaces.
- **Future Work**: Plans to implement additional methods and functionalities.

## Installation

To use the `F1` module, simply clone this repository to your local machine.
